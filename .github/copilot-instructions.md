This is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

- Use the `src/` directory structure with components in `src/components/`.
- Follow a dark-theme-first design with the indigo (`#6366f1`) accent color.
- Keep components modular and reusable.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling — avoid custom CSS where possible.
- Prefer server components by default; only use `"use client"` when interactivity is needed.
